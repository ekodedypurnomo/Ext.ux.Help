Ext.ux.Help
===========

This extension implements a set of classes used to manage help content
in an Ext JS application. It's designed to be simplistic but easy to use,
and it supports two basic types of help content presentation:  

* tabulated panels with content tree to provide organized and categorized
information
* popup windows for context sensitive help.

All pages are stored as simple text documents that use Markdown tags to
provide basic formatting. Content index is stored in JSON file; at present
there is no automatic index generation so it should be prepared manually.

Tested in:

* MSIE 6+
* Chrome 6+
* Firefox 3.6+
* Opera 11+
* Safari 4+

For usage, see demo application.
